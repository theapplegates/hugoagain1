Uvalde, Texas (CNN)Just before killing 19 children and two teachers in a Texas elementary school Tuesday, the 18-year-old gunman allegedly texted a girl who lives in Germany about his intentions.

According to screenshots reviewed by CNN and an interview with the 15-year-old girl -- who said she had been in contact with the gunman for weeks -- Salvador Ramos complained about his grandmother being "on the phone with AT&T abojt (sic) my phone."
"It's annoying," he texted.
Six minutes later, he texted: "I just shot my grandma in her head." Seconds after that, he said, "Ima go shoot up a(n) elementary school rn (right now)."
